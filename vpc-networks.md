# VPC Networks

VPCs are isolated, private partitions for resources. They contain abstractions for routes, rules and IP addresses. VPCs are global, span regions, and are composed of regional subnets. IP addresses, routes and firewall rules all exist inside a VPC network.

##### Types of VPC

* Auto mode
* Custom mode

##### Things to remember

* VPC must exist inside a project
* AWS VPCs are confined to a region whereas Google VPCs span across regions
* Google VPCs have subnets \(sub-networks\) that are confined to a single region. A resource \(either on default VPC or custom VPC will also have to be on one of the subnets\)
